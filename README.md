# Caesar's cipher - Opanuj JS project
**This is a practical project from [Opanuj JavaScript](https://przeprogramowani.pl/kurs-javascript?utm_source=landing) course, the project is about creating Caesar's cipher(ROT13).**


## What is Caesar cipher ?

**[From wikipedia: ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)**
>In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.
The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

So **Caesar's cipher** is a simple data encryption technique, it is based on an offset of letters in the Alphabet. In this project I will use 13-letter offset: [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13)
